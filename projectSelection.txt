RedRunner is visually pleasing platform game written in C# . It is open source and available on Github (see https://github.com/BayatGames/RedRunner).
This project is over 11k lines of code long. The fact that it is developed in Unity will make visualizing and analyzing the code structure a lot easier. The fact that it is developed by a company most likely means that we will be working with better than average code.
Contribution to the project is not only allowed, but is very much encouraged by the developer (see https://github.com/BayatGames/RedRunner/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Having been well documented and having several tickets for continued development,
this domain could envolve several possible improvements to the current code-base 
worth researching for the use of this project. There are JIRA issues that are 
tickets ideal to be investigated by developers new to Apache. See link for details: 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-8955?jql=(project%3DSOLR%20OR%20project%3DLUCENE)%20AND%20resolution%3DUnresolved%20AND%20labels%3Dnewdev
Examples of tickets are "uppercase problem in querying parameters," and 
"add min() or max() on string". There are other tickets of larger scope that are also 
possible canidates for project work.
